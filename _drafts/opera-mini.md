Earlier this year, [Jen Simmons](http://jensimmons.com/) asked the following question:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">From your memory, which browser has now twice the user base of Internet Explorer (globally)? (Don’t cheat — what’s your impression?)</p>&mdash; Jen Simmons (@jensimmons) <a href="https://twitter.com/jensimmons/status/824023709925212160">January 24, 2017</a></blockquote>

I managed to get the right answer (UC Browser) by virtue of elimination, not because I actually knew the statistics <span class="emoji" role="img" tabindex="0" aria-label="face with stuck-out tongue & closed eyes">&#x1F606;</span>. But what I do know, is that one of the options I have on my phone was not on that list. Yes, this is my semi-fail segue into talking about Opera Mini. Writing is hard <span class="emoji" role="img" tabindex="0" aria-label="person shrugging">&#x1F937;</span>.

## Who uses Opera Mini?

Guess what? I do. I'm reasonably confident that I am possibly the only person in Singapore using a [BLU Win HD LTE](http://www.gsmarena.com/blu_win_hd_lte-7205.php). It currently runs on Windows 10 Mobile, and I like it. Microsoft Edge uses EdgeHTML as its layout engine and Chakra as its Javascript engine. Both desktop and mobile versions use the same engine, which is more than I can say for iOS browsers.

Anyway, back to Opera Mini. The browser usage share for February 2017, according to StatCounter is 3.3%. That's actually more than Edge 14 (1.49%) and Safari 10 (1.54%) combined. Regionally, the lion's share of users for Opera Mini are from Africa, followed by Asia.

Africa is a significant market for Opera and they have focused on developing features that address key challenges for people in that region: high data costs, limited network capacity, growing page weights and background data consumption. These challenges apply to lower-income countries in other regions as well.

## Different modes on Opera Mini

Opera Mini has different modes, which affect data consumption and also rendering. Each of the operating systems uses a version of Opera Mini with a different set of modes. Check out the full table, lifted from [Opera Browsers, Modes & Engines](https://dev.opera.com/articles/browsers-modes-engines/).

There are 4 Operating Systems that can run Opera Mini: Android, iOS, J2ME and Windows Phone, and 3 different rendering engines depending on which mode is chosen.
