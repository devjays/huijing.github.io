This is my second consecutive "Fun with CSS" post, maybe this should become a series. But anyway, I had watched the video of [Ethan Marcotte](http://ethanmarcotte.com/)'s talk at [An Event Apart](http://aneventapart.com/) called [Laziness in the Time of Responsive Design](https://vimeo.com/165061923), and was fascinated by his progressive enhancement demo. It starts at around the 48 minute mark where he starts covering animation.

The transaction in this case, is simply to make a choice and submit it. This can be achieved with a form consisting of a simple set of radio buttons and a submission button. I highly recommend watching the entire talk, definitely lots to take away from it. The end result of the demo was really cool, and I wanted to recreate it, just for kicks.

Wasn't as straightforward as I thought, largely because the code snippets in the presentation were focused only on the key parts of the implementation, but to get the entire thing to work required some more effort. I also took a lot of [Harry Robert](http://csswizardry.com/)'s guidance on how to structure CSS to heart, especially after I watched [CSS for Software Engineers for CSS Developers](https://vimeo.com/177216958). So this experiment took me around 2 days, and a lot of that time was spent just thinking about how to structure my CSS classes and HTML. <span class="kaomoji">¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯</span>
