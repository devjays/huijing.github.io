So there's this thing going on known as the [TechLadies Bootcamp](http://www.techladies.co/). TechLadies is a community-led initiative for women in Asia to connect, learn, and advance as programmers in the tech industry (I lifted that verbatim from the website <span class="emoji">ðŸ˜›</span>). I was helping out with one of the pre-bootcamp workshops covering, what else, HTML and CSS.

The goal of the workshop was to introduce the basics of the Internet, plus an introduction to HTML and CSS. Our task for the day was to style a simple Ruby application, called Guess The Number. Although the application was built in Ruby, the participants only needed to concern themselves with the views portion.

Of course, given I was supposed to be teaching this workshop, I figured I'd better do some leg-work first, and try my hand at styling the application myself. I guess I got a little carried away, in that things got a bit too fancy for a beginner's workshop. But it was really fun for me and I'm going to outline everything I did
