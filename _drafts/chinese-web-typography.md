If you hadn't realised by now, I am Chinese. I was born in Malaysia, then studied and now work in Singapore. Like many others with similar backgrounds, we speak both English and Chinese with native fluency, plus a smattering of other languages and dialects here and there. 

A couple of months back, I went down a rabbit hole while researching my article on CSS display and discovered the HTML ruby element. There was also an article by [Ahmad Shadeed](https://ishadeed.com/) on [CSS Writing Mode](https://ishadeed.com/article/css-writing-mode/) that was making its rounds on the interwebs. And this got me thinking about Chinese typography on the web. 

## But first...a little history

To be fair, Chinese history is too vast a subject for a blog post. It warrants an encyclopaedic series of tomes. So let's talk about Chinese characters. Chinese is a logographic writing system, whereby each character itself holds meaning, whether alone or as part of a phrase. Until I researched this topic, I didn't realise that Chinese is the only logographic writing system left that is widely used in the modern world.

A [common misconception about the origin of Chinese writing](http://www.comdesignlab.com/typochina/chinese/archives/98) is that 甲骨文 (literally translates to Oracle bone script) was the earliest form of Chinese characters. These characters were carved onto animal bones or turtle shells, and mainly used for divination during the Shang dynasty. However, given its level of sophistication, Professor Zheng Huisheng posited Chinese writing had its roots in an earlier form, 陶文 (script etched on ancient pottery). Regardless, Chinese script underwent thousands of years of evolution over the dynasties before maturing into the form we know and use today.

Besides the characters themselves, we also need to examine how these characters were laid out into texts. Traditionally, Chinese characters were written from top to bottom, right to left. Nowadays, it is quite common to see Chinese texts being laid out in a typical Western horizontal layout, and read from left-to-right instead. The first known publication that utilised a horizontal layout was 《科学》, a science magazine which, in its inaugural issue on January 1915, attributed the choice of horizontal layout purely for the sake of convenience of printing formulae.

Talk about 新文化运动, punctuation 


## Research-triggered brain dump

Horizontal scrolling
vertical scroll because western languages are read from left to right then top to bottom
westerners had a step up when it came to digital, first mover advantage
imagine an alternate reality where Eastern culture reigned supreme
Would we already have solved the input problem?
Chinese did invent paper and printing Bi Sheng movable type
