*This is the first post of a multi-part series about Chinese typography, from the history of Chinese characters, to printing, to digitisation.*

Writing (and talking) about CSS writing modes last year served as a foray into the wonderful world of Chinese characters and typography. Even though I learnt Chinese as a first language in school all those years ago, I think I was too dumb or ignorant to appreciate the Chinese language itself. Kinda like those 8 years worth of piano lessons I took until I was 12. Ah, youth.

I mean, in school, they literally just taught you how to read and write, form sentences and understand passages. But I never took the time to appreciate the characters themselves. I didn't even realise Chinese was the only widely used logographic language left in the world today until I wrote that blog post.

Now just because I was late to the party, doesn't make Chinese characters any less fascinating. Turns out the library stocks a good number of books on the topics of Chinese characters (shout out to the Singapore [National Library Board](https://www.nlb.gov.sg/) <span class="emoji" role="img" tabindex="0" aria-label="smiling face with heart-eyes">&#x1F60D;</span>), and one particularly good one I found is [The Culture of Chinese Characters](https://www.amazon.cn/%E6%B1%89%E5%AD%97%E6%96%87%E5%8C%96-%E9%9F%A9%E9%89%B4%E5%A0%82/dp/B005WTNHHM) by Han Jiantang, Assistant Professor at Tianjin Normal University. A lot of what's to follow is referenced from this book. Okay, story time!

## Evolution of Chinese characters

A language is closely intertwined with the culture, history and identity of the people who use it. So there'll constantly be historical references to Chinese history as we examine Chinese characters. Of course, the further back in history we go, the more missing pieces there are, and often we, in the present, have to do our best to draw inferences and conclusions from secondary sources and archaeological remains.

Chinese civilisation has a very long history dating back to the Mesolithic age, based on prehistoric pottery shards found in Jiangxi, China<sup><a href="#ref1">[1]</a></sup>. In fact, China can be considered the oldest continuous civilisation in the world. Here's a general timeline, because visualisations help comprehension (who said that? I did <span class="emoji" role="img" tabindex="0" aria-label="smirking face">&#x1F60F;</span>).

*Insert timeline here*

So for the longest time, Chinese civilisations were ruled by dynasties. Dynasties which rose and fell over those thousands of years, which kinda puts things into perspective, at least for myself. On the one hand, it might just be that I'm in the middle of a lull period for China, and who knows how the next century will play out? 

Provided the planet still exists.

Oh, was that too morbid? What can I say? I'm genuinely worried we're going to blow ourselves up <span class="emoji" role="img" tabindex="0" aria-label="pensive face">&#x1F614;</span>. Anyway, moving on...

One of the most significant developments in Chinese civilisation is the standardisation of the Chinese language by the First Emperor of Qin (秦始皇), after he successfully conquered all the other states and unified China.

### Pottery etchings (陶文)

*insert timeline portion*

Professor Zheng Huisheng (郑慧生老师) from Henan University posited that [Chinese writing had its roots in 陶文](http://www.comdesignlab.com/typochina/chinese/archives/98) (script etched on ancient pottery), which came about during the Neolithic age. The script was comprised of line symbols and pictographs which were used to convey message and meaning.

### Oracle bone script (甲骨文)

*insert timeline portion*

By the Shang dynasty, the writing system had developed into a reasonably sophisticated script. Oracle bone script（甲骨文）was discovered by Wang Yirong（王懿荣）, a historian and scholar in the late Qing dynasty. He was also an avid collector of cultural relics and became intrigued with an ingredient called "Dragon bone" used in one of his traditional Chinese medical prescriptions. 

After further procuring a batch of these "Dragon bones", he was able to discern that they were actually turtle shells, specifically, turtle plastrons (just a fancy way of referring to the underside of the shell) and there were many glyphs etched on them. Upon careful inspection, he noticed that some of the glyphs bore resemblance to modern Chinese characters.

There is a monumental tome of ancient Chinese history called the Records of the Grand Historian（太史公书）, now known as 史记. It was started by Sima Tan（司马谈） and finished by his son, Sima Qian（司马迁）, during the Han dynasty. It records the history of China from the Yellow Emperor（黄帝）to Emperor Wu of Han（汉武帝）. This is relevant because it helped Wang Yirong figure out these turtle plastrons were used by the ancient Chinese for divination purposes (turns out the ancient Chinese of the Shang were a superstitious bunch).

Oracle bone script is very pictographic in nature, for example, the word for sun kinda looks like a sun, and the world for mountain looks like 3 peaks. Here are the glyphs for sun, mountain, moon, paddy field, rice grains and home respectively.

The thin strokes and limited curves stem from the fact that turtle plastrons and animal bones are very hard and thus aren't easy to carve. As mentioned earlier, Oracle bone script as a language was pretty sophisticated already, complete with verbs and pronouns. Although the characters themselves were far from the standardised characters we see today. I mean, everyone draws a bird or fish differently <span class="emoji" role="img" tabindex="0" aria-label="person shrugging">&#x1F937;</span>.
