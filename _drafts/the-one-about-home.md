At the end of 2016, I published a website called [Penang Hokkien ÊßüÂüéÁ¶èÂª∫ËØù](http://penang-hokkien.gitlab.io). Just a few months prior, I had started playing around with the CSS writing-mode property after having a random thought on my daily bicycle commute to work. That grew into a really long blog post on [Chinese typography on the web]({{ site.url }}/blog/chinese-web-typography/), and an experimental [layout-switching demo](https://www.chenhuijing.com/zh-type/). During that period, I also discovered the [Penang Hokkien Podcast](http://penanghokkien.com/).

Penang Hokkien is a variant of the Hokkien dialect that is unique to the northern states of Malaysia, and is essentially the lingua franca of Penang. It is also my mother tongue, and the main language spoken within my household. Penang Hokkien holds a special place in my heart. It represents where I come, where I belong, it is the language of home.

Given that building websites is one of those things that I'm sort of decent at, I figured I'd build a website dedicated to Penang Hokkien, specifically, stories about the unique usage of certain words and phrases that aren't used elsewhere. And because I also LOVE playing with CSS, it was an excuse to extend my earlier writing-mode demo into a fully-fledged website.

## Some logistical decisions

All my previous demos and random side-projects were hosted on GitHub as project pages tied to my user account. I'm too cheap to buy additional domain names, so all of them are subsites of www.chenhuijing.com <span class="emoji">ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è</span>. But for this site, I really wanted it to stand alone
