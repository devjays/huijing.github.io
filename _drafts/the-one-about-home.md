At the end of 2016, I published a website called [Penang Hokkien ÊßüÂüéÁ¶èÂª∫ËØù](http://penang-hokkien.gitlab.io). Just a few months prior, I had started playing around with the CSS writing-mode property after having a random thought on my daily bicycle commute to work. That grew into a really long blog post on [Chinese typography on the web]({{ site.url }}/blog/chinese-web-typography/), and an experimental [layout-switching demo](https://www.chenhuijing.com/zh-type/). During that period, I also discovered the [Penang Hokkien Podcast](http://penanghokkien.com/).

Penang Hokkien is a variant of the Hokkien dialect that is unique to the northern states of Malaysia, and is essentially the lingua franca of Penang. It is also my mother tongue, and the main language spoken within my household. Penang Hokkien holds a special place in my heart. It represents where I come, where I belong, it is the language of home.

Given that building websites is one of those things that I'm sort of decent at, I figured I'd build a website dedicated to Penang Hokkien, specifically, stories about the unique usage of certain words and phrases that aren't used elsewhere. And because I also LOVE playing with CSS, it was an excuse to extend my earlier writing-mode demo into a fully-fledged website.

## Some logistical decisions

All my previous demos and random side-projects were hosted on GitHub as project pages tied to my user account. I'm too cheap to buy additional domain names, so all of them are subsites of www.chenhuijing.com <span class="emoji">ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è</span>. But I really wanted this site to stand alone. 

Sometime last year, I learned that [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/gitlab-com/) had [GitLab Pages](https://pages.gitlab.io/) and always wanted to try it out, but never had a compelling reason to. Until now. It wasn't the smoothest experience (largely due to my own ineptitude), but it wasn't terrible either. And I kinda like GitLab to begin with anyway. I [wrote about the experience]({{ site.url }}/blog/hosting-static-site-gitlab-pages/) as well.

## Flexing the brain muscles

Content creation is not easy. If you find it easy, well, good for you then. I tend to write English more often, simply because English is the main language used in my industry. I use Chinese mostly when speaking, or messaging my friends. And I speak Hokkien with family or go back to Penang.

Even though I'm lucky enough to have learnt English and Chinese reasonably well, I sometimes still fall into the trap of direct translation. It depends on whether I'm thinking in English or Chinese at the time. Most of the time, I'll catch these when I do a second read-through. In fact, the best thing to do (at least for me) is to do the editing after taking a nap. <span class="emoji">üôÉ</span>

There are also times when you find there is no good English equivalent for a certain Chinese phrase or vice versa. Those are the times that make my brain hurt. And because I made the ridiculous decision to record a Penang Hokkien version of each story, there's a second round to translation to be done. So content creation for this site was quite the workout for the linguistic part of my brain.
