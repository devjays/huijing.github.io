When we talk about printing, what we're actually describing is a method of duplication for text and images. Before any mechanical methods were devised, the most straightforward method is copying by hand. Earliest books and manuscripts were handwritten by scribes trained in the art of language and writing. But it seems that human beings generally have ingenuity in spades, and it was probably inevitable that we developed mechanical devices to aid our efforts.

## Precursors to printing

The earliest forms of such devices are seals and stamps, which are still in use today. Other techniques include ink squeezes for rubbings, and stencils. 
According to Tsien, the carving and impressing of seals is considered one of the technical precursors of the invention of printing in China. Making a seal involves carving a mirror image of whatever you wanted to reproduce in relief on a material that was sturdy enough to carry this impression for multiple stampings.

Chinese have been using seals for the longest time, all the way back to the Shang dynasty. Seals could have been made in any reasonably hard material, from metals like bronze or silver to stone, jade, ivory or wood. They were usually used as proof of authentication or authority, with inscriptions of a person's name and title. Seals were often stamped with red ink on paper documents or books.

Rubbings are used to obtain “prints” from inscriptions on hard surfaces like stone, metal or bone and so on. Paper is moistened, then laid on top of the inscription and squeezed against the surface. Ink would then be applied on the drying paper with a pad. What resulted was the inscription in light on the dark ink applied all over the paper. This technique dates quite far back, to before the 6th century.

Stencils were created from sheets of thick paper perforated with needles to create the intended design to be duplicated. This technique can be traced even earlier than rubbings, supposedly all the way back to the 2nd century.

## Woodblock printing

Of course, this also had an impact on the methods of duplication for text. The most basic copying technology is simply transcription, which was the de facto method of duplication in Europe before printing. Medieval transcription culture blossomed during the Middle Ages as demand for texts increased. This is evidenced by the large collection of medieval manuscripts that are still preserved in various national museums, libraries and universities all across Europe.

Transcription was also popular in the East, but as demand for books grew, the invention of printing technology was inevitable. The earliest mechanical printing method for duplication of texts was woodblock printing, invented in China during the Tang dynasty, one of the most prosperous eras in Chinese history between 618-907AD. 玄奘, who went to India on a pilgrimage to retrieve the Buddhist sutras, returned to China in 645AD, and proceeded to translate them, as well as print and distribute images of Samantabhadra（普贤菩萨）on huifeng paper（回锋纸）.

The first complete printed book is probably the Diamond Sutra, dated 868AD. From the level of detail of those facial expressions and robes, we can see how advanced woodblock printing techniques had developed in China by that time. The method of woodblock printing persisted all the way till the Qing dynasty and beyond. Woodblock printing was an integral part of Eastern printing culture, coexisting with and complementing moveable-type printing during the later years.

Woodblock printing was introduced to Europe through Russia, likely by the Mongols, who crusaded along the Silk Road to the West. Evidence of woodblock printing could be found in Europe by 1400, but at the time they were mostly crude cuts, serving as illustrations for new printed books. Although block-printed books were produced in Europe, for example, the Speculum Humanae Salvationis and the Ars moriendi. They were largely used for thin volumes, and mostly religious texts like the Biblia pauperum. Woodblock printing was never a major method for text duplication in Europe. By the time woodblock printing reached Europe, transcription infrastructure was very strongly established, and woodblock printing could not replace it.

Moveable type was too pioneered in China. Invented by an ordinary citizen, 毕昇, during the 庆历 reign from 1041-1048. 毕昇's invention was recorded in 梦溪笔谈 by 沈括, using ceramics to manufacture his types. The Chinese used a variety of other materials for making types, like clay, wood, bronze, tin and even lead. Moveable-type printing had a number of advantages, mainly its speed and flexibility in typesetting, making it possible to print all types of books. Moveable types could also be shared between printers. Travelling craftsmen could just carry a load of wood types and set up wherever they could.

Korea adopted 毕昇's idea of moveable-type printing during the Kingdom of Goryeo (koh-ryah) and brought it to new heights during the Kingdom of Joseon (cho-san). The government set up Chuja-so or the Bureau of Type Casting, which casted hundreds and thousands of metal types, as well as official printing offices in every province. The hallmark of Korean printing was the mass production of metal types, mostly bronze, by casting. This technique of casting was pioneered by the Koreans, with cast metal types being in use before 1239. And with the volume of types cast, they'd honed their techniques to levels far beyond that of other countries. Records have shown that Choe Yun-ui (chue-yon-ne), a Korean civil minister, printed Sangjeong Gogeum Yemun in 1234. And the earliest moveable-type printed book still in existence today, is Jikji, a Korean Buddhist text, dated 1377, three-quarters of a century before Gutenberg.

However, moveable-type printing never really took off in China, and there are various reasons for this. 
1. Moveable type was widely used across Korea, but barely used at all in China. 
2. The Chinese printers also used a different method from the Koreans to manufacture types, choosing to engrave the types as opposed to casting them. Typesetting was challenging, and there were inking problems with these types. 
3. The choice to engrave types as opposed to casting them pushed up the manufacturing cost of types immensely as well. 
4. Furthermore, economies of scale only kicked in for large production runs, but printers were often wary of overstocking and often only printed a hundred copies per run. The resetting of type was troublesome and uneconomical when compared to woodblocks for such quantities. 
5. Given the lack of emphasis and development of moveable-type printing, the quality of prints left much to be desired as texts were littered with mistakes. 
6. Besides, with the long tradition of woodblock printing, the Chinese were exceptional at it. If any technical improvements were necessary for mass produced prints, they would probably have chosen to refine woodblock printing rather than replace it.

Over in Europe, by the mid-15th century, Gutenberg had printed his first book, Ars grammatica by Aelius Donatus, using moveable type. Even though he did not invent the idea of moveable type, he can be credited for making it work in Europe. Moveable type became the de facto technique for printing in the West, and moveable type technology surged forward through the centuries since. Moveable type printing suited alphabetic languages very well, given there was only a small fixed set of types required to print entire books. But at the end of the day, type is simply a tool for communication, a means to record and duplicate ideas onto a physical medium.


## Lithography

>The Chinese made concious choices. A society's willingness to accept the value of certain kinds of technology when presented with various options all at the same time, rather than sequentially, as happened in the West, is influenced by its own history and culture. Although Western printers surmounted multiple difficulties in creating serviceable early Chinese type fonts, their efforts were eventually thwarted by Chinese emphasis on the aesthetics of calligraphy in particular. As a result, from 1876 to 1905, Chinese visual sensibility led to major Chinese investments, not in moveable-type letterpress printing operations, but in lithographic ones.

> On the one hand, lithography, the most important Western technological alternative to techniques of casting and setting type for use with printing presses, provided a culturally sensitive compromise between the limitations of both Chinese xylography and imported typography. On the other hand, after 1905, Chinese-designed type fonts, which could be harnessed to fast letterpriess printing presses, edged out both lithography and the old missionary fonts just in time for use in late Qing educational and revolutionary movements.
