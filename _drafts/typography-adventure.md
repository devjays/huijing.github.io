I went to Argentina for vacation last year and it was splendid. One of the places we went was the [Cementerio de la Recoleta](https://turismo.buenosaires.gob.ar/en/otros-establecimientos/recoleta-cemetery) in Buenos Aires. Originally the garden of [Basílica Nuestra Señora del Pilar](http://www.basilicadelpilar.org.ar/), it became the city's first public cemetery back in 17 November 1822, and was designed by French engineer, Próspero Catelin.

This isn't just any ordinary cemetery, in fact, it's the grandest final resting place I've ever seen thus far. The entire cemetery is laid out like a city, with ornate mausoleums lining the "streets", each with their own unique architectural style. There were plenty of angels and crosses, even gargoyles, adorning the crypts. And what caught my eye were the wide range of font styles used for engraving plaques, or directly etched into the facade itself.

The cemetery itself had modest beginnings when Próspero Catelin was brought in to work on it, introducing the cemetery's city-style streets and blocks. The Recoleta district was transformed from a working class area to an upper-class neighbourhood after a terrible yellow fever epidemic in 1870. Recoleta, which was on a higher terrain, had less of the disease-carrying insects, but only the upper-class families had the means to move there.

However, as victims who died from the epidemic were not allowed to be buried there, the cemetery gradually fell into disrepair. In 1881, the cemetery was renovated and remodelled by Italian architect Juan Antonio Buschiazzo to a neoclassical style, including the grand front entrance with Doric columns. From then on, the mausoleums started to get grander and more elaborate as the city's elite started to move in.
