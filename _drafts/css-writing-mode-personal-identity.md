I was born in Malaysia, a Southeast-Asian country made up of the southern portion of the Malay Peninsula and part of the island of Borneo. Ethnically, I am Chinese, and if I'm not mistaken, my ancestors migrated from the Fujian Province in China 3 generations ago and settled in Penang. My family then moved south to Johor when I was 3, and my childhood was split between Singapore and Malaysia. I lived in Johor and commuted to Singapore for school every day. I now live and work in Singapore.

If you were keeping track, that paragraph mentioned 4 different geographical locations. When someone asks me, where are you from? The answer varies depending on who is asking and my mood at the time. Sometimes I'm from Penang, sometimes I'm from Johor, sometimes I'm from Singapore. Singapore and Malaysia are not very big countries, and I've encountered quite a lot of people outside of Southeast Asia who don't know where we are.

I happen to be a front-end developer who loves experimenting with CSS. The way CSS works just makes sense to me, even if some people beg to differ. Late last year, I started experimenting with a particular property called `writing-mode` which allowed text to be laid out vertically. There aren't that many vertical scripts in the world, but I happen to know one of them. Chinese, I'm talking about Chinese.

At the time I was just trying to find out why Chinese was written vertically but ended up learning a lot more about the Chinese language and Chinese culture in general than I ever learned in school. I've always found language intriguing. In my mind, language is how something ethereal and intangible like an idea can start to become real. It solidifies thought into something physical. And what I realised is that a language is intrinsically tied in with the culture that uses it.

There was 1 line from Moonlight that stuck with me. It was when Kevin asked Chiron, “Who is you?” It made me ask myself that question, and made me think about all the ways we categorise ourselves and others. In his book [Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind](http://www.ynharari.com/book/sapiens/), Yuval Noah Harari proposes the idea that Homo sapiens rule the world because of our unique ability to believe in things that only exist in our imaginations. It is an idea that resonated with me. 

> All societies are based on imagined hierarchies, but not necessarily on the same hierarchies. [...] In most cases the hierarchy originated as the result of a set of accidental historical circumstances and was then perpetuated and refined over many generations as different groups developed vested interests in it.

Human beings seem to have an inherent need to be part of a group. It probably stems from the fact that we aren't built to survive on our own. Newborn human babies are among the most useless creatures in terms of ability to stay alive. Our relatively large brain size requires the infant to be born before it can no longer fit through the birth canal. And requires extra care from adult humans to nurture their offspring to a state where they can care from themselves.

Between this phenomena and our penchant for believing in shared myths, we managed to build societies and cultures. The tricky part about these shared myths is that they are dependent on a collective belief in what Harari refers to as an imagined order, an inter-subjective order. This means it exists in the imaginations of so many people that any one individual cannot hope to alter it on their own. Even if he or she stops believing, it will make little difference in the grand scheme of things. Only a cataclysmic event can change an existing imagined order, and even then, it will only result in the belief of an alternative imagined order.

Growing up at the intersection point of Eastern and Western culture 

As someone who drew the long straw in the game of life, I am fully aware of how fortunate I am to be in the situation I am in. Through no merit of my own, I was born to a Malaysian-Chinese couple of teachers, who made the decision to send me to school in Singapore. By the time I knew what was going on, we were already a middle-class family. Apparently times were harder before I was born. But I've had and still have, the privilege of options in life.

During my stint with the national team, one of my coaches casually remarked, “you know, if I were like you and had a good education, I probably wouldn't be here anymore, I'd be out there making a fortune.” Women's basketball is not a glamorous sport in Malaysia, there is hardly any money to be made, but as a national team, there is some government support. It is not usual for someone with a choice to attend university in Singapore to pass up that opportunity simply to play basketball full time.



Who are you when no one is around? Is who we are dependent on the environment around us? I do know I am a slightly different person when I am with different people.
